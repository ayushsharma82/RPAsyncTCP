## Why RPAsyncTCP?

RPAsyncTCP brings the **asynchronous** networking power of ESPAsyncTCP to **RASPBERRY_PI_PICO_W with CYW43439 WiFi**, serving as the foundation for advanced libraries like `AsyncWebServer_RP2040W`.

### Features

- Handles multiple connections simultaneously
- Callbacks are triggered when requests are ready
- Faster response handling and improved efficiency
- Support for WebSockets, EventSource (Server-Sent Events), and URL Rewriting
- Static file serving with cache and indexing support
- Simple template processing

### Why Async is Better

- No blocking executionâ€”code execution continues while data is sent
- Faster and more efficient handling of network events
- Ideal for high-performance applications requiring simultaneous client handling

### Supported Boards

- **RASPBERRY_PI_PICO_W with CYW43439 WiFi** (using [arduino-pico core](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico))
- **Pico 2W (RP2350)**

## Examples

Check out the example projects:

- [AsyncTCP_Client](https://github.com/ayushsharma82/RPAsyncTCP/tree/main/examples/ClientServer/AsyncTCP_Client)
- [AsyncTCP_Server](https://github.com/ayushsharma82/RPAsyncTCP/tree/main/examples/ClientServer/AsyncTCP_Server)

---

## Debugging

Debugging is enabled by default on Serial. You can adjust the log level by modifying `_RPAsyncTCP_LOGLEVEL_` in the library files:

```cpp
#define _RPAsyncTCP_LOGLEVEL_ 1
```

---

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, ensure you are using the latest board core version. Updating may resolve compatibility problems.
